The code used to extract and summarize the data from the dataset above can be found in:
run_analysis.R - This script imports data from the following dataset and utilizes the dplyr library.

A description of the data and the variables can be found in:
CodeBook.md

Tidy dataset files can be found in:
TestAndTrainingMeansAndStDev.txt
SubjectActivitySummary.txt

The first tidy dataset TestAndTrainingMeansAndStDev.txt is created through the following steps found in run_analysis.R

* The script reads in the text files containing both the training and the test data.
* Activities and subject information is merged into each dataset independently along with column headers.
* The training data is appended to the test data creating a single data file, where the column names are updated to be more easily read.
* Using the combined dataset, a new dataset is creating containing only mean and standard deviation information.
* Save dataset to TestAndTrainingMeansAndStDev.txt

The second tidy dataset SubjectActivitySummary.txt is created using the first tidy dataset through the following steps found in run_analysis.R

* Update the column head names to include avg (average)
* The data is grouped by activity and subject
* Creates a summarized data set containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
* Save dataset to SubjectActivitySummary.txt


Notes: 
======
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
